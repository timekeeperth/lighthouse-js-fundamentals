var age = 15;

function whichSchool(age) {
  return (age < 13) ? "Elementary School"
       : (age >= 13 && age <= 18) ? "Secondary School"
       : "University"
}

console.log(whichSchool(15))




Conditional (ternary) Operator

The conditional (ternary) operator is the only javaScript operator that takes
three operands. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if
statement.

function getFee(isMember) {
  return (isMember ? "$2.00" : "$10.00");
}

Another example is to display a different message based on the value of the isMember
variable, you use this statement:

'The fee is ' + (isMember ? '$2.00' : '$10.00')

> console.log(getFee(true));
$2.00
undefined

> console.log(getFee(false));
$10.00
undefined

> console.log(getFee(1));
$2.00
undefined
>

SYNATX

condition ? expr1 : expr2

if condition is true, the operator returns the value of expr1; otherwise, it returns
the value of expr2.

A simple example to test whether or not you're old enough to legally drink alcohol in USA.

var age = 26;
var canDrinkAlcohol = (age > 21) ? "True, over 21" : "False, under 21";
console.log(canDrinkAlcohol);
"True, over 21"

Another example is to display a different message based on the value of the isMember
variable, you use this statement:

'The fee is ' + (isMember ? '')

You can also assign variables depending on a ternary result:

var elvisLives = Math.PI > 4 ? 'Yep' : 'Nope';

Multiple ternary evaluations are also possible (note: the conditional operator
is right associative):

var firstCheck = false,
    secondCheck = false,
    access = firstCheck ? 'Access denied' : secondCheck ? 'Access denied' : 'Access granted';

console.log(access); // logs "Access granted"

You can also use multiple conditions like in a multiple-conditions IF statement
s
var condition1 = true,
    condition2 = false,
    access = condition1 ? (condition2 ? "true true": "true false") : (condition2 ? "false true" : "false false");

console.log(access); // logs "true false"
